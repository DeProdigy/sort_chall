Sorting Code Challenge

Work for 10 minutes with a partner whiteboarding out how you would implement sorting a deck of cards.
What if you can only compare two cards at a time?
How would you sort an array of random numbers?

Now pick your poison: Ruby or Javascript.

The basic sort methods have been overridden.  It's up to you to implement a new sort function.

Name your function in the following format: `name_sort()`

Examples:

`function marceline_sort()`

or

`def coco_sort`

Write your test in the corresponding Javascript or Ruby `sort_spec` file.

Then spend 30 minutes implementing your code in the corresponding `sort` file.
